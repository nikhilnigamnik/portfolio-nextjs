# UI Libraries in React Native

React Native has a rich ecosystem of UI libraries that can help you build beautiful and performant mobile applications. Here are some popular ones:

## 1. React Native Paper

React Native Paper is the cross-platform UI kit library containing a collection of customizable and production-ready components, which by default are following and respecting the Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines.

As a cross platform UI Toolkit, you can now use RNE on the web & share your codebase between your React Native + React web apps. RNE components are rendered perfectly on browser. You can achieve this to target iOS, Android and Web by collaborating RNE and React Native for Web.

## 4. Fluent UI

Fluent UI React is the official open-source React front-end framework designed to build experiences that fit seamlessly into a broad range of Microsoft products. It provides robust, up-to-date, accessible components which are highly customizable using CSS-in-JS. Get started with Fluent UI React.

## 5. Tamagui

Tamagui lets you share more code between web and native apps without sacrificing the two things that typically suffer when you do: performance and code quality.

It does this with an optimizing compiler that outputs platform-specific optimizations - it turns styled components, even with complex logic or cross-module imports, into a simple div alongside atomic CSS on the web, or a View with its style objects hoisted on native.

## 6. NativeWind

[Visit](https://www.nativewind.dev/)

NativeWind uses Tailwind CSS as scripting language to create a universal style system for React Native. NativeWind components can be shared between platforms and will output their styles as CSS StyleSheet on web and StyleSheet.create for native.

## 7. Gluestack UI

[Visit](https://ui.gluestack.io/)

gluestack-ui is a universal UI library that provides optionally styled and accessible components. These components are designed for easy integration into applications developed with React and React Native.

## 8. Ignite UI

[Visit](https://docs.infinite.red/ignite-cli/)

Ignite comes with a number of customizable built-in React Native components -- sort of a lightweight design system, in a way. It's the system we (at Infinite Red) tend to use the most often with our own custom mobile designs, and is designed to emphasize flexibility and customizability over out-of-the-box power.

## 9. React Native Resuables

[Visit](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/getting-started/introduction/)

Universal shadcn/ui for React Native: Copy, paste, and tailor components to suit your specific requirements.

## 10. React Native UI Kitten

UI Kitten is a React Native UI Library that allows you creating stunning multi-brand cross-platform mobile applications. The library is based on Eva Design System which brings consistency and scalability in the design and development process. It contains a set of general purpose UI components styled in a similar way. And the most awesome thing: the themes can be changed in the runtime, with no need to reload the application.
